      <h3>CHARGEBACKS</h3>
      <p>
        If at any time, we record a decline, chargeback, reversal, payment dispute, risk of payment fraud or other rejection of a charge of any payable fees on your RentAKloud account (&ldquo;
        <strong>
          Chargeback
        </strong>
        &rdquo;), this will be considered a breach of your payment obligations hereunder, therefore you agree that RentAKloud may pursue all available lawful remedies in order to obtain payment, including but not limited to, immediate termination, without notice to you, of your RentAKloud account. In addition, this will also result in disabling the option to checkout with a credit card for your RentAKloud account to limit the risk of payment fraud.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the event a Chargeback is performed, your RentAKloud account may be blocked without the option to re-purchase or re-use it, and any data contained in such a RentAKloud account, including any certain content, features, or capacity of your RentAKloud account may be subject to cancellation and loss of data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your use of the RentAKloud Services and the ability to checkout using credit card will not resume until you:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          verify the payment method used for the disputed transaction, either by providing:
        </li>
        <li>
          proof of the payment; or
        </li>
        <li>
          pay any applicable fees in full, including any fees and expenses incurred by RentAKloud and/or any third-party services for each Chargeback received (including fees for RentAKloud Services provided prior to the Chargeback, handling and processing charges and fees incurred by the payment processor).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Cases related to criminal fraud chargebacks or obvious payment fraud (i.e. cases where compromised credit card details were used to make purchases) will result in permanent service and account termination without any option to recover.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have any questions or concerns regarding a payment made to RentAKloud, we encourage you to contact RenatAKloud at support@rentakloud.com in order to prevent the RentAKloud Services from being canceled and your RentAKloud account being blocked, and to avoid the filing of an unwarranted or erroneous Chargeback, which may result in you being liable for its applicable fees, in addition to re-payment of all the fees applicable to the RentAKloud Services purchased (and charged-back) by you.
      </p>
      <p>
        We reserve our right to dispute any Chargeback received, including by providing the relevant credit card company or financial institution with any information and documentation proving that the User responsible for such Chargeback did in fact authorize the transaction and make use of the Services rendered thereafter.
