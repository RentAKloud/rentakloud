      <p>
        If at any time you have questions about our practices or any of your rights described below, you may contact

      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          What information we collect, how we collect it, and why
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Much of what you likely consider personal information is collected directly from you when you:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          create an account or purchase any of our Services (ex: billing information, including name, address);
        </li>
        <li>
          request assistance from our customer support team (ex: phone number, voice recordings);
        </li>
        <li>
          complete contact forms or request newsletters or other information from us (ex: email); or
        </li>
        <li>
          participate in contests and surveys, or otherwise participate in activities we promote that might require information about you.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <strong>Supplemented Data</strong> may be received about you from other sources, for example, from publicly available databases, social media
        platforms, or third parties from whom we have purchased data, in which case we may combine this data with
        information we already have about you so that we can update, expand and analyze the accuracy of our records,
        identify new customers, and provide products and services that may be of interest to you. If you provide us personal
        information about others, or if others give us your information, we will only use that information for the specific
        reason for which it was provided to us.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          How we utilize information
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We strongly believe in both minimizing the data we collect and limiting its use and purpose to only that
        (1) for which we have been given permission,
        (2) as necessary to deliver the Services you purchase or interact with, or
        (3) as we might be required or permitted for legal compliance or other lawful purposes:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          Delivering, improving, updating and enhancing our Services
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We collect various information relating to your purchase, use and/or interactions with our Services. We utilize this information to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Improve and optimize the operation and performance of our Services (again, including our websites)
        </li>
        <li>
          Diagnose problems with and identify any security and compliance risks, errors, or needed enhancements to the Services
        </li>
        <li>
          Detect and prevent fraud and abuse of our Services and systems
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Much of the data collected is aggregated or statistical data about how individuals use our Services is not linked to any personal information.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          Sharing with trusted third parties
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We may share your personal information with affiliated companies within our corporate family, with third parties
        with which we have partnered to allow you to integrate their services into our own Services, and with trusted third
        party service providers as necessary for them to perform services on our behalf, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Processing credit card payments
        </li>
        <li>
          Serving advertisements (more on this topic below)
        </li>
        <li>
          Conducting contests or surveys
        </li>
        <li>
          Performing analysis of our Services, customer demographics, and sentiment
        </li>
        <li>
          Communicating with you, such as by way of email or survey delivery
        </li>
        <li>
          Customer relationship management
        </li>
        <li>

          Recruiting support and related services.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We use Stripe for payment processing. The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS) apply to all
        processing, transmitting and storing of card data. RentAKloud uses Stripe checkout functionality and web elements so
        that your payment processing is done in a PCI compliant manner. RentAKloud never sees the card data. The payment
        information is directly transmitted to the Stripe servers.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will also disclose your information to third parties:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets (whether a result of liquidation, bankruptcy or otherwise), in which case we will disclose your data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets; or
        </li>
        <li>
          if we sell, buy, merge, are acquired by, or partner with other companies or businesses, or sell some or all of our assets. In such transactions, your information may be among the transferred assets.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>
          Communicating with you
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We may contact you directly or through a third party service provider regarding products or services you have signed up
        or purchased from us, such as necessary to deliver transactional or service related communications. We may also contact
        you with offers for additional services we think you&rsquo;ll find valuable if you give us consent, or where allowed to
        contact you based on legitimate interests. You don&rsquo;t need to provide consent as a condition to purchase our goods
        or services. These contacts may include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Email</li>
        <li>Text (SMS) messages</li>
        <li>Telephone calls</li>
        <li>Messenger applications (e.g. WhatsApp, etc.)</li>

      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          Transfer of personal information abroad
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you utilize our Services from a country other than the country where our servers are located, your personal information may be transferred across international borders, which will only be done when necessary for the performance of our contract with you, when we have your consent to do so, or subject to the appropriate standard contractual clauses.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          Compliance with legal, regulatory and law enforcement requests
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (such as subpoena requests), to protect our property and rights or the property and rights of a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we consider to be illegal or unethical.
      </p>
      <p>
        To the extent we are legally permitted to do so, we may take reasonable steps to notify you if we are required to provide your personal information to third parties as part of a legal process.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          How we secure, store and retain your data
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We follow generally accepted standards to store and protect the personal information we collect, both during transmission and once received and stored, including utilization of encryption where appropriate. We retain personal information for as long as required to engage in the uses described in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required by applicable law.
      </p>
      <p>
        The criteria used to determine our retention periods include the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide Services to you (for example, for as long as you have an account with us or keep using our Services);
        </li>
        <li>
          Whether we have a legal obligation to keep the data (for example, certain laws require us to maintain records of your transactions for a certain period of time before we can delete them); or
        </li>
        <li>
          Whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as regarding the enforcement of our agreements, the resolution of disputes, and applicable statutes of limitations, litigation, or regulatory investigation).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you have any questions about the security or retention of your personal information, you can contact
        us at <a href="mailto:privacy@rentakloud.com">privacy@rentakloud.com</a>.

      <p>
        If you make a request to delete your personal information and that data is necessary for the products or services you have purchased, the request will be honored only to the extent it is no longer necessary for any Services purchased or required for our legitimate business purposes or legal or contractual record keeping requirements.

      </p>
      <p>
        Some browsers allow you to automatically notify websites you visit not to track you using a &ldquo;Do Not
        Track&rdquo; signal. There is no consensus among industry participants as to what &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; means in this context.
        Like many websites and online services, we currently do not alter our practices when we receive a &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; signal from a visitor&rsquo;s browser.
